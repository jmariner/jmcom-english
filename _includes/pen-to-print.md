# Pen to Print

## __The Printing Process__

### When were Shakespeare’s plays usually printed?
After the production company would no longer perform them.

### How much money did Shakespeare make off of the printed scripts?
None

### An experienced printer “__casts off__” the book. “__casting off__” is estimating how many pages will be in the book and determining how much of the handwritten text will fit on the page.

### How did we come up with the terms upper and lower case?
Uppercase letters were stored in the top compartment of the Type Case; lowercase were stored in the lower compartment

### How many pages could they print an hour?
Around 200

### What happened when they underestimated the text?
Not enough text to fill the page – sometimes broke iambic pentameter lines in half or added their own lines to the text

### What happened when they overestimated the text?
Too much text to fit on a page – sometimes lines are cut completely or lines of verse were turned into prose to make it fit


## __Shakespeare’s Language__

### Shakespeare’s vocabulary included over __27870__ words. The average person today uses between __7500__ and __10000__ words.

### List as many of Shakespeare’s made up words as you can:
Advertising, bedroom, cold-blooded, jig, manager, numb, obscene, zany, Xantippe, shooting star
