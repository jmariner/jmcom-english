#Sophomore Year

##Memories and Metaphor
Tenth grade was definitely the start of something new for me, for better or for worse. This year I decided that I would rise to the high expectations set by the Math and Science Academy (MSA) and take multiple AP classes. This quickly turned out to be a mistake and a blessing: on one hand, I struggled through AP Europeon History, further growing my disinterest for history; on the other hand, I flew through AP Computer Science with so much ease that I tended to forget it was an AP class and aced the exam with a 5 despite feeling I had done worse. My struggles in AP Euro were not in vain, though: I learned that if I'm going to take an AP class, I need to make it something that interests me or else I might end up giving less than my best effort. I kept to this trend from this point on, even choosing a college that specializes in technology and doesn't force uninteresting topics such as history. Similarly, this was my first year with the option to take 8 classes due to the new day schedule that was created, and once again, feeling pressured by the high standards of the Academy, I opted to fill all 8 spots, not giving myself any study block time. Another lesson learned: I work best at school, so I definitely regret not giving myself some room in my schedule, especially with the 2 AP classes. This was also a very important year for the MSA: the Academy created mandatory classes that were intended to better prepare us for our eventual senior Capstone project. This showed me that my class, the class of 2016, is a very important one to the Acadamy: we were the lab rats; we were the Freshman class for the first Symposium and now we were testing the waters for a brand new mandatory class. I also continued my trend of doing some random programming whenever possible: with the extremely-popular (at the time) webpage game 2048 blowing up everywhere, I took a suggestion from a few friends and made a modified version of it. This served as my introduction to website development and I definitely retained that interest for sure.
