#Freshman Year

##Memories and Metaphor
Ninth grade was the beginning of many things. I was welcomed with was an interesting nickname with an even more interesting backstory. On the first day of school I wore a shirt saying "Virginia Tech" but the strap from my backpack was covering the word "Tech." A classmate, Jonah Lapira, decided my nickname that would stick forever: "Virginia." I saw no reason to argue his logic: my shirt ended up saying "Virginia" right where a nametag would go, so obviously that was actually my name. Jonah soon ended up being one of my closest friends for all of high school. Freshman year also showed me what it really takes to succeed in high school, especially in the Math and Science Adademy. I was not ready for high school, so I made some pretty bad mistakes. I started off my year by putting off my Magnet English summer assignment until *after school started*, giving a very negative first impression to my new classmates and teachers. But a member of my group for the project using that summer assignment was Jonah, and him and the oher group members, who he already knew from middle school, helped me every step of the way.
