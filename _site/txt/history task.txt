The History
For this page, you are becoming the teacher. What do you think is important for people to know and understand about English History from this period? You must cover briefly a broad range of topics.

How you assemble this information is up to you. You must only use the websites I am providing. If you find other sources you think have value, you MUST FIRST CHECK WITH ME. 

#1 Rule. You have to find a way to put it on the page so it doesn’t look like a paper. Use subcategories to describe English life at the time.  Incorporate pictures. Look at how the websites you are getting the information from are displaying the information.
