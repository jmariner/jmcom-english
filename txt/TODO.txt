homepage:
	get more pictures
	make hover animation that shows a summary of the category
		animation plan: title fades away, desc fades in. use js?
		OR just slide the title up and position the desc 100% below it
	
each picture (and maybe heading?) can be clicked to show its source (and a button to go to it)
